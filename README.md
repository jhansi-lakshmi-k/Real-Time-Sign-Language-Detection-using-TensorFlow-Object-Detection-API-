Real-Time Sign Language Detection using TensorFlow Object Detection API

This project demonstrates a real-time sign language recognition system built using the TensorFlow Object Detection API. It detects hand gestures representing letters or signs from sign language via live webcam input.

##  Overview

With the rise of deep learning and computer vision, real-time gesture recognition has become increasingly achievable on consumer hardware. This project trains a custom object detection model (SSD MobileNet V2) to identify hand signs and enables real-time detection using a webcam feed.
